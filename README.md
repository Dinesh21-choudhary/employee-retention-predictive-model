# employee-retention-predictive-model
I have used the machine learning and deep learning model to figure out which Employees may quit.
Understanding the problem and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Data cleaning and preparation
Machine Learning Modeling + Deep Learning
After the comparing with the different models with thier accuracy,recall,precision,F_score. The Random Forest classifier was the best model for predicting which employee may quit with high accuracy,recall and other statistics
its not always that deep learning model can make a difference but yes they do make difference when the data is huge where the other machine learning model would fail the deep learning model can raise the bar.
